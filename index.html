	<h3>About Me</h3>

	<img id="portfolioImage" src="assets/images/linkedin.png" alt="About Me">

	<p> Hello! My name is Francis and I am a beginner to the world of coding. I absolutely love it so far. There are many times that I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing, but I'm trying my best to work hard and tap every resource I possibly can in order to succeed. I am determined to turn this passion into a rewarding career. </p> 

	<p> I have a background in elementary education. Prior to that, like many college graduates, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I felt the call to be an educator and pursued it but after four years in the field, I've learned that my heart's just not in it. I haven't felt the same passion and sheer interest in anything since coding's come along.
